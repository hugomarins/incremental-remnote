 * How many tag writes are kept in flight.

 * Measured, on a 413k-rem knowledge base: a write costs ~74ms of LATENCY, which
 * sequentially is 13.5 writes/s — against a plugin bridge measured at ~1,800-2,000
 * calls/s. The pipe therefore sits ~99% idle, waiting. Overlapping writes should
 * convert almost all of that idle time into throughput.
 *
 * MEASURED, AND IT DOES NOT WORK. Do not raise this again without new evidence.
 *
 * The reasoning above predicted a near-linear speedup, and it was wrong. Two runs
 * of 1,173 writes on the same document, at 16 in flight:
 *
 *   sequential   74ms per write    13.5 writes/s
 *   16 in flight  1,116-1,237ms      13-14 writes/s
 *
 * Latency rose by almost exactly 16x (74 x 16 = 1,184) while throughput did not
 * move at all. That is the signature of complete serialization: RemNote applies
 * tag writes one at a time, so the extra requests only queue behind each other
 * and every one of them waits out the whole queue. There is no idle capacity on
 * this path to reclaim — the bridge is idle, but the writer behind it is not.
 *
 * So the conclusion in lib/updated_at_probe.ts holds after all, for a different
 * reason than it was originally reached: overlapping plugin calls does not help,
 * whether the loop looks throughput-bound or latency-bound.
 *
 * Left at 1, which is plain sequential execution. The pool is kept because the
 * walk/write split it enabled is worth having on its own — progress can count
 * writes, which are the only slow part — and because a future SDK with a real
 * bulk tag API would slot in here. There is no such API today: the only
 * `addTags` in the SDK typings is a UI-location enum member.

 * Takes the HasImage tag off every rem that carries it within the scope.
 *
 * The cleanup half of the feature: the scan can mark 20k+ rems, and a user who
 * decides they no longer want the tag has no way to undo that in bulk from
 * RemNote's own UI. Nothing is lost — the tag is derived from the images
 * themselves, so re-running the scan rebuilds it exactly, which is also why this
 * needs no undo of its own. Same relationship "Remove All Priority Band Tags"
 * has to "Refresh Priority Badges".
 *
 * Membership comes from ONE `taggedRem()` call, so a whole-KB cleanup never
 * enumerates the knowledge base at all — it asks the tag who its members are.
 * Only a rem-scoped cleanup pays for a descendant walk, and even then just to
 * build the set it intersects against.
 *
 * Deliberately uses `removePowerup` rather than `removeTag(powerup._id)`, even
 * though the latter skips a code→rem resolution per write and is likely faster.
 * The point of this run is to measure the write cost against the tagging pass on
 * equal terms; changing the write API at the same time would leave two variables
 * moving at once, and the per-write cost is the open question here.
