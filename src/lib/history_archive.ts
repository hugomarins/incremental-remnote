 * Reviews of deleted Rems drop out of everything the plugin can read: RemNote
 * moves the cards to a trash that no SDK call reaches, and purges it after two
 * weeks. The desktop helper reads remnote.db and keeps every rep it ever saw.
 * This module asks it for the "ghosts" (reps whose card or Rem is no longer
 * live) and keeps only those that no live history still holds.
 *
 * Rep identity is the timestamp in ms, across kinds: Preserve history & remove,
 * Dismiss and Transfer to parent all keep a rep's `date` while moving it to
 * another Rem or kind. So a ghost whose timestamp is in any live history is
 * already counted there and is dropped.
 *
 * Desktop only, and optional: when the helper is not running every call here
 * resolves to null and callers keep what they had.
